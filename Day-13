# Day 13 of #100DaysOfCode

Today I solved the following LeetCode problems in C++:

## âœ… 704. Binary Search  
**Problem Link:** [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)  
**Approach:** Used iterative binary search to find the target by narrowing the range based on comparisons.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size()-1;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
            if(nums[mid]==target) return mid;
            else if(nums[mid] > target) high=mid-1;
            else low = mid+1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

# Day 18 of #100DaysOfCode

Today I solved the following LeetCode problem in C++:

## âœ… 344. Reverse String  
**Problem Link:** [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)  
**Approach:** Reversed the character array in-place using a two-pointer approach from both ends toward the center.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        // reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        int n = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[n - i - 1];
            s[n - i - 1] = temp;
        }
    }
};
```

Reversing in-place is both space-efficient and fast! ðŸ”„

## 📅 Date: May 24, 2025

## 👨‍💻 Problems Solved:

### 1. Smallest Index With Digit Sum Equal to Index
- **Platform:** LeetCode
- **Problem ID:** 3550
- **Description:** Find the smallest index `i` in an array such that the digit sum of `nums[i]` equals `i`.
- **Approach:** Loop through the array, calculate digit sum using modulo and division, compare it with the index.
- **Status:** ✅ All test cases passed
- **Language:** C++

### 2. Find Words Containing a Character
- **Platform:** LeetCode
- **Problem ID:** 2942
- **Description:** Given an array of strings and a character, return all indices of strings that contain that character.
- **Approach:** Nested loop to check each character in each string; if found, index is added to the result.
- **Status:** ✅ All test cases passed
- **Language:** C++

### 3. Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing
- **Platform:** LeetCode
- **Problem ID:** 1909
- **Description:** Determine if it's possible to make the array strictly increasing by removing at most one element.
- **Approach:** Traverse array and count violations of strictly increasing order. If violations > 1, return false.
- **Status:** ✅ All test cases passed
- **Language:** C++

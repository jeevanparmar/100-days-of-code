## âœ… Today's Progress
Solved two LeetCode problems in C++:

### 1. [Reverse Prefix of Word (LeetCode #2000)](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-prefix-of-word/)
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Problem**: Given a string and a character, reverse the substring from the start up to the first occurrence of that character (inclusive).
- **Approach**:
  - Used `string.find()` to locate the index of the character.
  - Reversed the substring using `reverse()` with iterators.


### 2. [Valid Parentheses (LeetCode #20)](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Problem**: Check if a string of brackets is valid based on proper nesting and pairing.
- **Approach**:
  - Used a stack to manage open brackets.
  - Matched closing brackets with the top of the stack.


## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Better understanding of STL functions like `find()` and `reverse()`.
- Practiced stack data structure for validation problems.
- Improved speed and accuracy in solving easy-level problems on LeetCode.

## ðŸ”œ Goals for Tomorrow
- Solve at least one medium-level problem.
- Practice a problem involving recursion or backtracking.

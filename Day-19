# Day 19 of #100DaysOfCode

Today I solved the following LeetCode problem in C++:

## âœ… 1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get  
**Problem Link:** [Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-coins-you-can-get/)  
**Approach:** Sorted the array and picked the second largest from every triplet starting from the largest set to maximize the total coins. A classic greedy strategy.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& piles) {
        sort(piles.begin(), piles.end());
        int coins = 0;
        int n = piles.size() / 3;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int index = n + i * 2;
            coins += piles[index];
        }
        return coins;
    }
};
```

Loved applying a clean greedy logic today! ðŸŽ¯

# 100 Days of Code Challenge  👨‍💻

Welcome to my journey of 100 Days of Code! 🚀  
I’ve committed to learning and practicing coding every day to improve my problem-solving skills and grow as a developer.

## 📅 Day 8 - [1346. Check If N and Its Double Exist](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-n-and-its-double-exist/)
- 🧠 **Concepts Practiced:** Brute-force checking with nested loops
- 💡 **Approach:**
  Loop through each element and check whether there exists another element such that one is double the other.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkIfExist(vector<int>& arr) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.size(); j++) {
                if (arr[i] == 2 * arr[j] || arr[j] == 2 * arr[i])
                    return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};

# Day 64 – 24 July 2025

Today I solved one LeetCode problem in C++.

---

## ✅ 169. Majority Element

### Problem
Find the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times in an array of size n.

### Approach
Sorted the array and returned the middle element, which is guaranteed to be the majority element.

### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        return nums[nums.size() / 2];
    }
};
